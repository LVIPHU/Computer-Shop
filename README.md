## Purpose

The purpose of the application is to provide an e-commerce platform for consumers and vendors to buy & sell products. It takes inspiration on modern applications like eBay or Amazon. Data sources are self-generated, but they conform to some schema from Amazon products datasets [[1](https://data.world/promptcloud/fashion-products-on-amazon-com.)], [[2](https://data.world/promptcloud/amazon-product-listing)], [[3](https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)].

NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 3001
MONGO_URL = your mongodb uri
JWT_SECRET = set your secret key for JWT token
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = your paypal client id
ALGOLIA_APP_ID = your algolia application API
ALGOLIA_API_KEY = your algolia admin api
```

Create a .env file in the **client/** folder

```
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
```

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)

```
npm install
cd client
npm install
```

### Run

```
# Run frontend (:3000) & backend (:3001)
npm run dev

# Run backend only (with nodemon)
npm run server

# Run backend only (without nodemon)
npm run server

# Run frontend only
npm run client

# Test
npm run test
```

**Note**: for seeding the data, you should destroy data first then import them.

### Seed Database

You can use the following commands to seed the database with some sample users and products as well as destroy all data

```
# Import data
npm run data:import

# Destroy data
npm run data:destroy
```

**Sample User logins**

```
ahihi@test.com (Admin)
